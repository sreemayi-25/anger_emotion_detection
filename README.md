# Anger Emotion Detection using Digital Image Processing

This project focuses on detecting **anger emotion** from facial expressions using image processing techniques. Two approaches are implemented:

## üîç Approaches Used

1. **Haar Cascade + Rule-Based Detection**
   - Detects face and landmarks using Haar Cascade.
   - Measures eyebrow distance, wrinkle density, eye/mouth ratios, and lip tension.
   - Applies custom rule-based logic for emotion classification.

2. **Dlib with 68 Facial Landmarks**
   - Uses Dlib to extract detailed facial landmarks.
   - Calculates geometric ratios to detect anger-specific patterns.
   - Offers improved accuracy with more feature points.

## üõ† Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anger-emotion-detection.git
cd anger-emotion-detection
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For Dlib:

* Ensure `CMake` is installed.
* On Windows, you may need Visual Studio Build Tools.
* On macOS/Linux, use `brew install cmake` or `apt install cmake`.

Refer to the [Dlib installation guide](http://dlib.net/compile.html) for detailed setup instructions.

## üß† Emotion Detection Logic

* **Eyebrow Distance**: Reduced in anger.
* **Wrinkle Density**: More prominent between eyebrows.
* **Eye Openness Ratio**: Often reduced.
* **Lip Tension Ratio**: High tension observed during anger.

These features are extracted from face landmarks and fed into custom logic for emotion classification.

## üí° Future Improvements

* Integrate Deep Learning-based emotion classifiers.
* Support multiple emotions (happy, sad, surprised, etc.).
* Deploy as a web or mobile application.
